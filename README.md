RPG Mini-Project
Using Node, Inquirer and JS classes create a role playing game in the Terminal. This project will not have a front end; all game play will happen in the terminal.
Allow the user to choose from a minimum of 3 characters. The computer will then randomly choose a character.
Each character will have the following characteristics: name, health points and attack points. Each character will also have the following methods checkHealth to determine if the player is still alive, attackOpponent(should decrease the opponent health by the character's attackPoints.), defend( should decrease a character's health points by half of the opponent attackPoints.) and increaseHealth(should increase a character's healthPoints but decrease attack points.).
Create at least 3 subclasses of the main character and give them different properties such as weapons, magic,special attack moves etc.
As the game is played, it gives the user the ability to attack their opponent, increase their health, or defend.
Each round the player will choose an action until either themselves or the computer has zero health points and the game is over. You can give your user the option to start again.
Note: Feel free to create as many characters, and methods as you like just keep in mind our limited time in class.
